    <h2>Description</h2>
    <br> Lasagna is a classic recipe that every cook should have in their rotation. Tender sheets of pasta, a creamy ricotta cheese filling, and a rich meaty tomato sauce are all topped with more cheese and baked until browned and bubbly. While there are a few steps to this lasagna recipe, it's easy to make and has so much flavor. This dish can be made ahead of time and freezes well either before or after baking!
